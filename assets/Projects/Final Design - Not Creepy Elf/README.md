## Not Creepy Elf

The *Not Creepy Elf* project aims to create a distinctive electronic decoration to enhance holiday celebrations, specifically for Halloween and Christmas. This product is designed to meet users' desire for a spooky decoration during Halloween and seamlessly transition into a playful “Elf on the Shelf” character for Christmas. The Not Creepy Elf is intended to delight guests with a combination of fright, humor, and excitement, making it an appealing addition not only for holiday gatherings but also for year-round enjoyment.

This interactive decoration offers two customizable modes for Halloween and Christmas. In Halloween mode, it delivers lighthearted scares to create a thrilling atmosphere, while in Christmas mode, it provides a family-friendly, festive experience. Although the Not Creepy Elf is crafted to entertain, it may also surprise users, achieving the intended spooky effect for Halloween but with a gentler approach for Christmas.
